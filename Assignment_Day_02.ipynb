Sarah is a dedicated teacher who wants to ensure the success of her students. She collects data on their test scores and attendance to gain insights into their academic performance. Using NumPy, she performs various computations and analyses to understand how her students are progressing. So help you as a Data Scientist help Sarah in following activities."
